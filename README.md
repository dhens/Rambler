## User Story

As an avid or aspiring hiker I want to be able to access and organize hiking trail data so that I can track and display my previously completed and future hikes. 

## Motivation

Rambler is an app that we built with the average person in mind. This app is designed not only as a resource for searching new hiking trail destinations, but also serves as a visual dashboard displaying previously completed and future user generated hike data. No special equipment or skill set required.  Rambler’s versatility is what sets it apart from the competition.

 Many hiking/fitness apps require the user to track their trips using GPS through either their phone or another third party device. Rambler is unique in that users don’t need to worry about forgetting to start their “trip” or their device running out of battery. Rambler users can relax, enjoy the outdoors and update completed hikes at their own convenience when they have returned from their adventure. Whether a seasoned or first time hiker, Rambler strives to provide a little of something for everyone.
